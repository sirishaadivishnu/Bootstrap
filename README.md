# Programming Language: Bootstrap

This repository contains the programs that I wrote during my traineeship as a full stack developer. These programs cover Bootstrap - CSS, HTML.

## Getting Started

To run these programs, you'll need to have a browser installed on your computer.

You can clone this repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/sirishaadivishnu/bootstrap.git
```

## Directory Structure

The repository doesn't contain any typical directory structure however, at the end of this Readme.md I have created a table to describe each program in the repository.

## Contributing

If you find any bugs or issues in the programs, please feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy coding!
